# Overview
Modifies an existing item's properties.

# Usage
To modify the properties of an item, select it in the hotbar like [this](HotbarSelection), then do `/set (Parameters)[Property] [Value]`. If you want to see the properties instead, check [Properties](Properties). Note that it will also return a list of properties upon successful execution(only if the setting ShowProperties is true). Examples:

`/set s 5` will make the currently selected item in the hotbar shoot Jester's Arrows.

`/set s 5 ct 26` will make the currently selected item in the hotbar shoot Jester's Arrows and place Demon Altars.
