### Uses
Item Testing, this mod can be used to modify items(for devs) without having to reload every time.

Building, properties like UseTime and UseAnimation can aid in building with faster building/breaking speeds, and properties like TileBoost can aid in reach, changing the item's UseTime and UseAnimation to their fastest(0,2 respectively) combined with Builder's Toolbox mod's Furious Worldforge aids greatly in building(modifying consumable variable for the item not to get consumed won't work on the Furious Worldforge).
